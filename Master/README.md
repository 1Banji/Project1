## Intro
Our Team consisting of Matt Newton & Banji Ajayi have been tasked by a renovation company to find out:
1. Does the house price go down as the age of the building increase?
2. Does the house price go down as time since renovation increases?
3. Where's the best place to market?

## Methodology
We decide on a five-prong, double flank attack strategy.This meant that we both tackled the same problems at the same time 
The five prongs consisted of:
- prong 1 Data cleaning
- prong 2 Exploratory data analysis
- prong 3 Modeling
- prong 4 Visualization
- prong 5 
 
## Findings
We found that:
1. The older the building the less it will sell for.
2. That a renovated building will sell for more.
3. The best house to market to are over the age of 54 years and in the suburbs.

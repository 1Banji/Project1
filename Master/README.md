## Intro
Our Team consisting of Matt Newton & Banji Ajayi have been tasked by a renovation company to find out:
1. Does the house price change as the age of the building increase?
2. House price and age in comparison renovated vs non-renovated? 
3. For houses of similar class (normalized) does renovation affect price?
4. Where's the best place to market?

## Methodology
We decide on a five-prong, double flank attack strategy. This meant that we both tackled the same problems at the same time. 
The five prongs consisted of:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Modelling
- Visualization
- Finalizing  
 
## Findings
We found that:
1. The older the building the less it will sell for.
2. That a renovated building will sell for more.
3. Renovated building cost more if all other factors are similar.
4. The best house to market to are over the age of 54 years and in the suburbs.
